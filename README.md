# 📚 BookArc — Cloud-Native Book Management & Recommendation Platform

> **Graduation Project** — Cloud Computing B.S., Luminus Technical University College (LTUC)  
> Built and deployed on AWS using serverless architecture, Infrastructure as Code, and modern frontend development.

## 🌟 What is BookArc?

BookArc is a fully serverless, cloud-native web application designed for book lovers. It enables users to discover books, manage personal reading lists, write reviews, compare prices, and receive intelligent personalized recommendations — all powered by AWS.

This project was built as my graduation capstone to demonstrate real-world cloud engineering skills: designing a scalable architecture, provisioning infrastructure with Terraform, securing access with Cognito, and delivering a fast frontend globally via CloudFront.

## ✨ Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🔍 **Book Discovery** | Search and browse an extensive book catalog |
| ⭐ **Reviews & Ratings** | Write reviews and rate books |
| 📋 **Reading Lists** | Create and manage personal reading lists |
| 💰 **Price Comparison** | Compare book prices across sources |
| 🤖 **Personalized Recommendations** | Custom recommendation logic powered by AWS Lambda |
| 🔔 **Notifications** | System notifications powered by AWS Lambda |
| 🔐 **Secure Authentication** | User registration, login, and session management via AWS Cognito |

## 🏗️ Cloud Architecture Overview

BookArc follows a **serverless, event-driven architecture** hosted entirely on AWS:

- The **React frontend** is hosted on **S3** and served globally through **CloudFront** for low-latency delivery.
- All API requests go through **Amazon API Gateway**, which routes them to **AWS Lambda** functions — no servers to manage.
- User data is stored in **Amazon RDS (MySQL)**, running inside a private subnet in a custom **VPC** for network isolation.
- A **Bastion Host (EC2)** in a public subnet is used for secure database administration — the RDS instance is never exposed to the internet.
- **AWS Cognito** handles all authentication, token management, and user pools.
- **AWS Lambda** also powers the recommendation engine and notification system — both implemented as dedicated Lambda functions triggered by user activity.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### ☁️ AWS Services

| Service | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **AWS Lambda** | Serverless compute for API logic, recommendation engine, and notification system |
| **Amazon API Gateway** | REST API management and request routing |
| **Amazon RDS (MySQL)** | Relational database for structured data |
| **Amazon Cognito** | User authentication and authorization |
| **Amazon S3** | Static frontend hosting and image/asset storage |
| **Amazon CloudFront** | Global CDN for fast content delivery |
| **Amazon VPC** | Network isolation with public/private subnets |
| **AWS EC2** | Bastion Host for secure database administration |

### 🧱 Infrastructure as Code

| Tool | What it Provisioned |
|---|---|
| **Terraform** | VPC, CloudFront, Frontend S3 Bucket, RDS |
| **AWS Console** | Cognito, API Gateway, Lambda, EC2, S3 Buckets |

### 🎨 Frontend

- **React.js** — Component-based UI
- Hosted on **Amazon S3**, delivered via **Amazon CloudFront**

## 🗄️ Database Design

BookArc uses a relational MySQL database hosted on Amazon RDS. The schema is designed to support users, books, reviews, ratings, reading lists, and recommendation tracking.

## 🔐 Security Highlights

- RDS database is in a **private subnet** — not accessible from the internet
- Database administration is done exclusively via a **Bastion Host** in a public subnet
- All API endpoints are protected with **AWS Cognito JWT tokens**
- S3 buckets are private; assets are served only through **CloudFront**
- VPC security groups follow the **principle of least privilege**

## 💡 Key Engineering Decisions

**Why Serverless?**  
Lambda + API Gateway eliminates server management, scales automatically with traffic, and reduces cost — you only pay for actual usage.

**Why Terraform for part of the infrastructure?**  
Core networking (VPC, subnets, RDS, CloudFront) is provisioned via Terraform for reproducibility and version control. This demonstrates Infrastructure as Code best practices.

**Why a Bastion Host instead of direct RDS access?**  
Direct public access to the database would be a major security risk. The Bastion Host pattern ensures the database is only reachable from an authorized, controlled entry point.
